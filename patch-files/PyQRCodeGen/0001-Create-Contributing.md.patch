+
+# Contributing to PyQRCodeGen
+
+:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:
+
+We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
+
+- Discussing the current state of the code
+- [Reporting a bug]( https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyQRCodeGen/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report_template.md)
+- [Submitting a fix](https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyQRCodeGen/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md )
+- [Proposing new features]( https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyQRCodeGen/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request_template.md)
+## Steps to follow :scroll:
+
+### 1. Fork it :fork_and_knife:
+
+You can get your own fork/copy of [PyQRCodeGen]( https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyQRCodeGen) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd></a> button.
+
+ [![Fork Button](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)](https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyQRCodeGen)
+
+### 2. Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:
+
+You need to clone (download) it to local machine using
+
+```sh
+git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/PyQRCodeGen.git
+```
+
+> This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.
+Once you have cloned the ` PyQRCodeGen ` repository in GitHub, move to that folder first using change directory command.
+```sh
+# This will change directory to a folder PyQRCodeGen
+cd PyQRCodeGen
+```
+
+Move to this folder for all other commands.
+
+### 3. Set it up :arrow_up:
+
+Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in GitHub :octocat:
+
+```sh
+git remote -v
+origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/PyQRCodeGen.git (fetch)
+origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/PyQRCodeGen.git (push)
+```
+
+Now, add a reference to the original [PyQRCodeGen](https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyQRCodeGen) repository using
+
+```sh
+git remote add upstream https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyQRCodeGen.git
+```
+
+> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.
+See the changes using
+```sh
+git remote -v
+origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/PyQRCodeGen.git (fetch)
+origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/PyQRCodeGen.git (push)
+upstream  https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyQRCodeGen.git (fetch)
+upstream  https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyQRCodeGen.git (push)
+```
+
+### 4. Sync it :recycle:
+
+Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.
+Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.
+
+```sh
+# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
+git fetch --all --prune
+# Switch to `master` branch
+git checkout master
+# Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repository's `master` branch
+git reset --hard upstream/master
+# Push changes to your forked `PyQRCodeGen` repo
+git push origin master
+```
+
+### 5. Ready Steady Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:
+
+Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing by checking our `Help Wanted` Issues and creating [pull requests](https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyQRCodeGen/pulls).
+
+### 6. Create a new branch :bangbang:
+
+Whenever you are going to make contribution. Please create separate branch using command and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).
+
+```sh
+# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and will switch to that branch.
+git checkout -b Branch_Name
+```
+
+Create a separate branch for contribution and try to use same name of branch as of folder.
+
+To switch to desired branch
+
+```sh
+# To switch from one folder to other
+git checkout Branch_Name
+```
+
+To add the changes to the branch. Use
+
+```sh
+# To add all files to branch Branch_Name
+git add .
+```
+
+Type in a message relevant for the code reviewer using
+
+```sh
+# This message gets associated with all files you have changed
+git commit -m 'relevant message'
+```
+
+Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using
+
+```sh
+# To push your work to your remote repository
+git push -u origin Branch_Name
+```
+
+Finally, go to your repository in browser and click on `compare and pull requests`.
+Use our [pull request template format]( https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyQRCodeGen/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md)
+Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort. 
+
+Sit and relax till we review your PR, you've made your contribution to our project.
